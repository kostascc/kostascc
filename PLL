Phase Lock Loop (PLL) is a control system used in electronics applications such as communication, frequency synthesizers, and microprocessors. It maintains the same phase between input and output signals by using a phase detector, low pass filter, and voltage control oscillator.

Phase lock loops are widely used in computing and communication applications. Notable examples include 
FM demodulation, frequency shift keying, clock recovery/generation for digital systems, noise reduction, frequency synthesizers. 
A typical PLL topology consists of a phase detector, a low pass filter, and a voltage control oscillator .
The phase detector compares input and oscillator frequency to generate an error signal.
XOR gate and phase frequency detector can be used as phase detectors.
XOR phase detector has limitations, while the phase frequency detector provides better performance.
PLL can multiply or divide input frequency using a divide by N counter in the feedback loop.

Phase lock loops are essential in various electronic applications, enabling synchronization, demodulation, clock recovery, and noise reduction.
The three main components of a PLL are the phase detector, low pass filter, and voltage control oscillator.
The phase detector compares the phase difference between input and oscillator signals, generating an error signal used to adjust the oscillator frequency.
XOR gate can be used as a phase detector, but it has limitations in terms of phase range and signal duty cycle.
Phase frequency detectors, using D-flip flops and AND gates, provide better phase detection and can identify leading or lagging signals.
PLLs can be used in frequency synthesizers to multiply or divide input frequencies by a factor of N, achieved by introducing a divide by N counter in the feedback loop.
Understanding the working principles and applications of PLLs is crucial for electronic engineers and enthusiasts to design and optimize electronic systems.

While targeting certain performance specifications, we are primarily interested in how the design
proceeds, what aspects of the circuit must be analyzed and simulated, and, most importantly, how the designer
thinks. This endeavor also gives us a feel for the performance bounds that we would typically encounter in
practice. Not every design choice leads to success, and we must often iterate on the values or
even circuit topologies.

In context of this thesis, our design targets are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reference Frequency = 20 MHz,
\item Output Frequency = 2.4 GHz,
\item Power Consumption = 2 mW,
\item Deterministic Jitter = 10 ps,pp,
\item Random Jitter = 2 ps,rms,
\item Supply Voltage = 1 V.
\end{itemize}

We observe that the loop has a divide ratio of M = 120. The reader is encouraged to review Chapters 3 and
7 before beginning this design study.

A key point in circuit design is to begin with the simplest topology and the smallest transistors unless our
experience suggests otherwise. We therefore start with a standard charge-pump PLL.

To choose loop parameters, we seek a method that readily leads to a basic design, anticipating
that we must perform refinements later.

While the proof is ommited in this paper, the close loop transfer function of Diagram \ref{fig:PLL_closed_loop_functions} is:
\begin{align}
	H(s) &= \frac{K_{PD} K_{VCO}}{ \frac{s^2}{\omega_{LPF}} + s  + K_{PD} K_{VCO} } \label{eq:PLL_close_loop_func} \\
	        &= \frac{ \omega _n ^2 }{ s^2 + 2\zeta \omega_n s + \omega_n^2 } \text{\space} . \label{eq:PLL_close_loop_func_universal}	
\end{align}

The two equations derived in Chapter 7 for type-II PLLs provide a
starting point:


\begin{align}
\zeta &= \frac{R_1}{2} \sqrt{ \frac{I_p K_{VCO} C_1}{2 \pi M} } \text{\space} , \label{eq:PLL_1} \\	
\omega _n &=  \sqrt{ \frac{I_p K_{VCO} }{2 \pi M C_1} } \text{\space} , \label{eq:PLL_2} 
\end{align}
where $K_{VCO}$ is the VCO gain, and $I_p$, $C_1$, $R_1$ are under our control.
We choose ζ ≈ 1, but how about ωn? Recall from Chapter 8 that the discrete-time nature of the loop requires that
the bandwidth (BW) be reduced to about one-tenth of the input (reference) frequency. But which bandwidth?
More relevant here is the open-loop unity-gain BW, ωu ≈ 2.1ωn for ζ = 1.
\begin{align}
	\omega _u = 2.1 \omega _n = \omega_{REF}/10 \text{\space} . \label{eq:PLL_3} 
\end{align}
 
 
 We now have two equations and three unknowns, and hence some freedom in the choice of the loop
 parameters. The charge pump current, in particular, can assume a wide range, with the lower bound governed
 by the charge pump noise (Chapter 8) and the size of the loop filter capacitor (because ζ ∝ ²IpC1). Let
 us select Ip = 100 μA. Note that the CP power consumption is typically quite small because, in the locked
 condition, Ip is drawn from the supply for only a brief amount of time, namely, the PFD reset time.
 
 from (\ref{eq:PLL_2}) and (\ref{eq:PLL_3}):
 \begin{align}
 	2.1 \sqrt{ \frac{I_p K_{VCO}}{2 \pi M C_1} } = \frac{ 2 \pi \cdot (20 \text{\space MHz}) }{10} \label{eq:PLL_4} 
 \end{align}
 
The discrete tuning plots in Fig. 3.42(c) yield KV CO ≈ 400 MHz/V. Bearing in mind that KV CO must be
expressed in radians/s/V, KV CO ≈ 2π × (400) Mrad/s/V, and withM = 120, we obtain

\begin{align}
	C_1 = 9.3 \text{\space pF \space} .\label{eq:PLL_5} 
\end{align}

Equating (\ref{eq:PLL_1}) to unity gives

\begin{align}
	R_1 = 35.9 \text{\space k } \omega \text{\space} . \label{eq:PLL_6} 
\end{align}

We can also select 
\begin{align}
	C_2 \approx C_1 / 5 \approx 1.86 \text{\space pF \space} . \label{eq:PLL_7} 
\end{align}
